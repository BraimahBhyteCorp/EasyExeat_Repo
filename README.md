# EasyExeat_Repository
This is the official file sharing Github for Bhyte Softwares GH
So far I've been able to build 2 pages of the program and link them up through button events. Its not much but its already been a tedious journey.
The .exe file of first Beta version can be found inside the #New_EZExeat Folder above inside, just look in /New_EZExeat/obj/Debug directory.For now we still have a far way to go. Some long term goals would have to be how to add a database and learning to implement a working SMS API into our code, but hopefully by Gods grace we will succeed eventually.
If you open the program .exe you might encounter some bugs  and problems, dont worry all of these will be fixed soon;
*Disable maximize and resize buttons
*Fix button borders
*Align text in button
*Change field to password box

Now I cant do all the work by myself. It'd be nice if some of you could get on board and learn some SQL/SQLite in order for us to create, add and store information as a database for the program when needed. I've provided some links for you to study from if interested

Ok so this is it so far. Lets hope for the best guys.
